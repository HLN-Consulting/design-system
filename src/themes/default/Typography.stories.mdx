# Typography

Accessible from the `theme` prop, there are three font options available to you by default: `display`, useful for headings and other standalone content; `ui`, the "default" typeset for text, content, and most UI components; `mono`, when a monospace font is necessary.

For example, you can utilize `${(props) => props.theme.typography.fonts.display}` in your styled components to use the theme `display` typeset.

These typesets include a bundled font family from a third party source, such as Google Fonts, and are built on a foundation of the [modern system font stack](https://devhints.io/css-system-font-stack) for maximum compatibility across browsers and operating systems.

## Bundled Font Families

An example of the non-system font families and weights included in the design system default themes.

#### Open Sans, 600 (bold)

<Typeset fontSizes={[11, 12, 14, 16, 20, 24, 29, 35]} fontWeight={600} />
