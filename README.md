React based design system for HLN's current and future projects.

## Installation

**Please note,** that this package is actively under development, and is not intended to be used in production environments at this time.

```bash
yarn add @hln/design-system
```

## Exploring the Design System

-   [`src/components`]() contains off-the-shelf React components, ready for use in your application
-   [`src/elements`]() houses items that make up `components`, as well as commonplace UI elements
-   [`src/themes`]() is where you can find theming options, including the default and dark mode themes

### Storybook

We utilize [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop, audit, and document the various elements, components, and theming options that the HLN Design System affords developers.

To initialize your own Storybook environment, simply run:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

## Contributing

As this package is actively under development, we are not actively seeking external contributors at this time.
